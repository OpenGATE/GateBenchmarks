This simulation is a PET benchmark.

DISCLAIMER: this is NOT a true PET device. 
It has been designed to check several Gate features.
It is not expected to give realistic results.

Run with:
Gate mac/main_centroid.mac 
Gate macmain_energyWinner.mac
or
source runTest.sh


Expected time: 0.6 sec


Run the analysis with 
runAnalysis_energyWinner.py
runAnalysis_centroid.py

Timing
