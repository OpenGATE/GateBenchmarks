# There may be problems since by default in PET there is this minSectorDifference.
# I do not know how this is read offline.
# Sorter with CC flag. I should put the flag outside as a parameter for PET
# I have the double of coincidences because I do not write single1 and single 2
# parameters but all together with the identifier for coincidenceID.
# This is how was done for CC. I could use RootDefs instead of CCDefs to keep same
# thing as for coincidences inside Gate


# INITIALIZE is needed to recover volumeID from hits using DetectorConstruction
